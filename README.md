# Food.Dot
Food.Dot is a website for finding the recipe that you want to cook or want to learn. Here you will find all latest and greatest recipes
with ingredients and the instructions video on how to make it.
This is one my side projects as well. In this project I tried to build erverything with api so I used themealdb api. I think I 
learned alot from it and I feel much comfortable with api's now.
